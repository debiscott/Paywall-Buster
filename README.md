## Paywall Buster: Using headless Chrome command line within PHP to display embedded image of remote website using JavaScript.

The Paywall Buster uses headless chrome and javascript to embed an image of a remote site in the webpage one is viewing. An example is to visit https://twitter.com/pulpnews, and click on any of the tweets. This takes you to a page with a button to see the website. If the user encounters a paywall when using a link, then they can press a bottom and get the remote website's image embedded on the page.
