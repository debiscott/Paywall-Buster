## Paywall Buster: Using headless Chrome command line within PHP to display embedded image of remote website using JavaScript.

The Paywall Buster uses headless chrome and javascript to embed an image of a remote site in the webpage one is viewing. An example is to visit [@pulpnews](http://twitter.com/pulpnews), and click on any of the tweets. This takes you to a dynamic page at oddcrimes.com. The dynamic page presents a button to take a snapshot of the remote website in real time and to display the image of it on the same webpage without the presence of a paywall blocker.

## The law.
Users decide their intent based on the law, [17 U.S. Code ยง 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107). 

## Required Resources.
Prerequisites:
  * Web server [virtual machine #1]
  * Backend server [virtual machine #2]
  * Database [this uses MySQL 5.5, but most databases can be used]
  * Shared folder that both virtual machines can access.

## What the user doesn't see.
When the user presses the button, the request is placed in the database. Virtual machine #2 monitors the databases every minute. When it sees a new entry, it takes the id number and gets the url. It uses headless chrome to go to the url and take a snapshot (pdf or html file types can be used instead of an image using the switches in the chrome command line). 

The image is saved on a virtual drive accessible by the webserver and a webpage that displays the full sized image is created.  If the user clicks on the embedded image, it will take then to the full size image page. It then deletes the databases record.

## Advantages of doing it this way.
 * The process cannot be interupted by the user, meaning that they can leave the page once the button is clicked and the process will complete.
 * Using the database to establish a queue so that only one chrome process is used, keeping resources used at a minimum.
 * The image is permanent, so it is accessed quicker the second time around.
 * Only the news item people are interested in are saved, limiting storage to only those images.

## Resources.
* [Headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome?hl=cat)
* Check out sharing folder between virtual hosts for the type of VM you are using.
